						<h2>Personal Information</h2>
						<p>My name is Jeremy, and I am studying a Bachelor of Informational Technology (IT) through the RMIT Open University program. On this page you will find information about me, what IT means to me now, and where I would like to go with it in the future, as well a personal idea for an IT project that I would love to see developed.</p>
						<p>I am a 37-year-old home-espresso enthusiast, SCUBA-diving fanatic, living in Sydney with my wife Ally and our 1-year-old son Alfie. I grew up in central Queensland, where Mum and Dad operated a large sheep station. We moved to Brisbane around the time I started high-school, and since then work has taken me up and down the coast between Brisbane and Melbourne.</p>
						<p>Finishing up high-school, I was interested in working in aviation, and drawn to a career as an air traffic controller. While controlling aircraft was exciting and engaging, I never felt comfortable in the job so later decided to hang up the headset and moved into aviation operations, where I continue to work today.</p>

				<section id="interest" class="wrapper style1 fullscreen fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
						<p>I have had an interest in IT since high school, probably starting with games and building and upgrading PCs. This led to taking up IT as a school subject, where I had my first exposure to programming and databases. I was particularly drawn to the logic and problem-solving nature of programming, experimenting through trial and error to reach an objective. Facing a problem and applying my skills in new ways to solve it really appealed to me.</p>
						<p>Since working in the aviation industry I have been continually exposed to IT on the user side. Recently I have been involved in shaping the development, testing, and implementation of proprietary software used to manage flying operations. Problem-solving issues again has reignited my interest in IT and led me to pursue studies at RMIT.</p>
						<p>The RMIT IT program stood out to me as a great option to further explore the world of IT. Ideally, I would like to move into more technical job roles that relate to my aviation industry experience. The program’s mix of delivering a broad IT knowledgebase with key technical skills may also open my eyes to something altogether new.</p>
						<p>Through my studies I hope to gain a broad depth of knowledge across the fundamental aspects of IT as well as the basis to continue to build expertise in fields I am drawn to beyond the degree. I also aim to gain contemporary technical skills which I can begin to apply in the short term, enabling me to use technology to innovate work practices in my workplace. Applying my own experience with newly taught skills, I expect to further develop all-important skills of collaborative work in an IT context.</p>

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						<p>To further illustrate what IT means to me, I have selected a job that appeals to me as a possible goal in my IT journey. By describing what appeals to me about this job and outlining a proposed path to achieving it, I hope to convey a bit more about myself.</p>

						<h3>Position Description</h3>
						<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53783952?type=standout#searchRequestToken=998b0e73-9a70-4665-b42e-bad9d5707a8e">Job Advertisement</a>
						<p>Sigma Bravo provide IT services to the Australian Defence Force, with a focus on aerospace software solutions. The role I am drawn to is that of a Software Tester, working in an agile Software Development team supporting an integrated flight scheduling and management software system used by military flying units.</p>
						<p>This position appeals to me as it draws together elements of my aviation industry experience, with aspects of IT that interest me. The position requires developing and undertaking software testing procedures and strategies including automated testing, working closely with the software development team to resolve issues, and ultimately ensuring a quality product is provided to the Defence Force.</p>
						<p>I am drawn to the hands-on nature of the position, operating the software from the perspective of the developer and the user, facilitating the bridge between user requirement and technical implementation.
						I’m particularly interested in the problem-solving nature of the position. Identifying issues and working in collaboration with the broader team to resolve them would be a frequently rewarding part of the job.</p>
						<h3>Position Description</h3>
						<p>Sigma Bravo are looking for an IT or Engineering qualified candidate. Requiring 3 years prior experience in a similar role, it is not a senior position, but does require the candidate to have proficiency in software testing practices, such as setting up test environments and performing test execution. Specific to this core skill, an ISTQB Software Tester certification is desirable.</p>
						<p>Collaboration is important in this role, with specific experience working in an Agile team a requirement. The Agile development process is focused on quickly delivering iterative working solutions with the ability to refocus the team’s objective as customer needs change or new ones emerge. Rather than a protracted project which aims to deliver an all-encompassing solution at its end, agile projects deliver prioritised elements and capability for quicker release and feedback from the customer (Atlassian, 2021). Aligned with this methodology, the role requires strong analytical skills and a methodical team focused approach. Specific to this role, collaboration is across technical and non-technical audiences, so strong communication skills are essential.</p>
						<p>Being Defence contractor, governance features heavily across the company’s projects. The role requires experience in technical documentation production and looks favourably on specific experience in military standards.</p>
						<p>Finally, Sigma Bravo would also look favourably on a candidate with specific technical experience or knowledge in the Microsoft software development and test product stack and SQL queries.</p>
						<h3>Relevant Skills I have</h3>
						<p>I believe I have some foundational skills and experience that apply to this position. I have been directly exposed to the operation, testing and development of aviation software systems from a user side and understand the safety-critical environment in which they are used.</p>
						<p>Working in an operations centre, I see parallels to the agile methodology. We deal with competing priorities regularly and must utilise the team’s different functions to quickly respond to emerging issues.</p>
						<p>As an air traffic controller, I used and contributed to technical documentation regularly. I understand the attention to detail required to maintain these products. I have also developed a methodical approach to tasks that is required in the aviation industry, both in a collaborative and individual setting.</p>
						<h3>Path to Gaining the Skills and Experience Required</h3>
						<p>Completing a Bachelor of IT will be the first significant step towards this goal. Throughout the degree I will develop the foundational technical skills with which to later build upon with relevant software testing specialist skills and qualifications. I will be directly exposed to collaborative IT work while developing communication skills, particularly as they apply to technical and industry specific practices. I will gain some basic skills assumed in this position, such SQL, and have opportunity to develop analytical skills in the context of IT issues.</p>
						<p>Further to university, additional industry education would put me in good standing. Software Tester specific certifications such as the desirable ISTQB would feature highly on this list. Outside of formal education, I believe technical skills are a perishable asset and require continued focus. This requires self-motivation to not only maintain these skills, but to keep them contemporary through informal and formal self-education across broad topics.</p>
						<p>Seeking initial IT positions to build relevant experience may entail leveraging my industry experience to move into a more technical role in the aviation industry. Ultimately the focus of this position is software testing and attaining a junior or graduate position in this field would be an ideal first move.</p>

						<h2>Myers-Briggs Profile</h2>
						<p>According to the Myers-Briggs Test I am an ISTJ-T, or ‘Logistician’ personality type. Defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make up the Logistician personality profile.</p>
						<h3>Traits of the Logistician:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Practical logic</li>
							<li>Preferring autonomy to a reliance on others</li>
							<li>Value honesty above emotional considerations, which can be seen as a blunt approach and leave a cold impression</li>
							<li>Tendency to keep opinions to self</li>
							<li>Calm and practical</li>
							<li>Can be stubborn to new ideas or change</li>
							<li>Strong opinion on how things are done</li>
							<li>Reluctant to give up responsibility even when overburdened, or if there is a better person for the job</li>
							<li>Can be inflexible</li>
							<li>Require clearly set steps and well-defined responsibilities</li>
							<li>Valuing stability, innovations and brainstorming of new ideas can disrupt</li>
							<li>Preference to operate by the book which can create aversion to innovation</li>
							<li>Can be tripped up where a practical and methodical approach limit developments</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I believe my Myers-Briggs Test results largely ring true in their descriptions and analysis of my personality. I am certainly an introvert, and the profile correlates with my tendencies to preference autonomous work and in keeping opinions to myself, relying on my actions and work to speak for me.  I found the test results particularly interesting in identifying traits which I would agree with upon consideration, but perhaps was not otherwise consciously aware of. This included a reluctance to give up responsibility to others even when overburdened myself. By being aware of these traits, I can take steps to draw on my strengths, and avoid their pitfalls.</p>
						<h2>Learning Style Profile</h2>
						<p>According to tests that assess preferences for visual, kinaesthetic, and auditory learning styles, I am primarily a visual learner.</p>
						<h3>Visual Learners</h3>
						<blockquote>Visual style is learning by seeing. You learn visually whenever you gain information from sight. This includes more than just the viewing of pictures and your surroundings. Visual learning also encompasses the written word.</blockquote>
						<blockquote>Visual learners benefit greatly from teaching that utilizes illustrations, charts, diagrams, videos, etc. They often feel a need to convert spoken instruction into visual form by taking notes.</blockquote>
						<h3>Traits of the Visual Learners:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Good at remembering people's faces</li>
							<li>Accurately recognises body language and facial expressions</li>
							<li>Able to picture things in their mind</li>
							<li>Good at taking notes in the form of text and doodles</li>
							<li>Comprehends visual information such as charts, graphs and diagrams</li>
							<li>Recalls appearances with ease</li>
							<li>Appreciates pictures and illustrations in books</li>
							<li>Enjoys learning from video presentations</li>
							<li>Learns well from flash cards</li>
							<li>Notices visual details that others might miss</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Awareness of your preferred learning styles is important in directing efforts in university, work, and life more broadly. Again, this testing confirmed my self-assessment that visual learning suits me. Testing did raise some valuable self-reflection of my preference for written word in understanding a topic. I have always valued illustrative detail when learning, but I think written word equally suits my preferred learning style.</p>
						<h2>Big Five Personality Profile</h2>
						<p>According to the Big Five Personality test, that measures OCEAN dimensions of personality - Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism – my personality traits measure as below:</p>
						<p>This testing highlighted to me a tendency for negative feelings. This is something I was not consciously aware of but is something to consider. Testing affirmed many of my own assertion and aligned with Myers-Briggs Testing that I am introverted and more practical than imaginative. I considered the high agreeableness value somewhat at odds with the stubbornness trait indicated in the Myers-Brigg. This duality is something to be aware of, it explains a tendency to concede where I should stand my ground.</p>
						<h2>How Do These Results Influence My Behaviour In a Team?</h2>
						<p>Working in a team, I am likely to assume followership roles. I would do well to consciously speak my mind where I may be inclined to hold back. I may resist change or new ideas in a group setting, particularly where previous methods have been established. Being aware of this, I should both keep an open mind, and value creative ideas from others. I am likely to resist giving up responsibility so should consciously consider my own capacity and strengths when work is assigned and delegated. As a visual learner, I may not always grasp ideas and concepts that team members communicate verbally. Aware of this, I may need to carryout my own research on topics through preferred visual methods.</p>
						<h2>How Should I Take This Into Account When Forming a Team?</h2>
						<p>When forming a team, it is important to seek out input from others that may compliment my strengths and weaknesses. I should seek out creative and outspoken types that can challenge my beliefs and offer new ideas. Having self-awareness of my own traits, I should make efforts to be open with team members where I may be inclined to withdraw.</p>
